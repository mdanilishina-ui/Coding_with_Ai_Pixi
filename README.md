# Pixi.js GitHub Pages Demo

A minimal Pixi.js playground that runs entirely in the browser—perfect for hosting with GitHub Pages. It draws a starry background with a handful of glowing orbs you can nudge around by dragging on the canvas.

## Running locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No bundlers or servers are required.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In your repository settings, enable **Pages** and point it at the `main` branch (root folder).
3. After GitHub finishes building, your demo will be live at the provided Pages URL.

## Customizing
- Edit `main.js` to tweak the Pixi scene or add new sprites.
- Update `styles.css` or the markup in `index.html` to change the layout and copy.
