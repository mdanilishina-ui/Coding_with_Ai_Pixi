# Warm & Cold – PixiJS Prototype

A single-level PixiJS experience that implements the agent responsibilities defined in `agents.md`. Move the pointer to heat up the background, find the hidden object before the timer expires, and tap the restart chip to try again.

## Running locally
1. Install Node.js (no additional dependencies are required).
2. Start the lightweight static server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the logged URL (defaults to `http://localhost:4173`) in your browser or simulator.

## Customizing
- Edit `src` modules to adjust game logic (placement, timer, warm/cold effect, UI).
- Update `styles.css` or `index.html` to tweak the landing layout and copy.
